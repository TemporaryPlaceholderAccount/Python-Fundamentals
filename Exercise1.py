#You can always make typos that creaate errors, simple misspellings and dropped characters are the single greatest cause of frustration and anger in every Software engineer I've met.
#Making sense of the error message is usually easy when you get to the actual error, see above. It usually spells out the problem pretty clearly. The REAL issue is when the code runs but doesnt do what you want and you have no obvious idea why
#Any typo in the actual print statement or a comment wouldnt cause an error, beecausee thee systeem doeesnt neeeed to definee thee teerms, see above and words preceding comma, and it's up to human observers to assign value to the characters.
